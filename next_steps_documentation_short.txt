Next Steps - Second Half of GSoC

Priority Features (Weeks 7-14)

1. Multiple Smart Controls for Single Alarm
Problem: Users can only set one smart control type per alarm (location OR weather OR activity).
Solution: Allow combining multiple conditions with logical operators (AND/OR).
Implementation: Extend AlarmModel, create condition builder UI, update backend evaluation logic.
Example: "Wake me when it's sunny AND I'm at work OR when it's raining AND I'm at home"

2. Timezone-Aware Alarms  
Problem: Travelers struggle with alarms when crossing time zones.
Solution: Automatic timezone detection and alarm adjustment.
Implementation: Integrate timezone APIs, create conversion utilities, handle DST edge cases.
Example: "Detected timezone change: NYC â†’ London. Adjust alarm to 7:00 AM GMT?"

3. Google Assistant Integration
Problem: Users want voice control for alarm management.
Solution: Deep Google Assistant integration for voice commands.
Implementation: Google Assistant Actions SDK, voice command parsing, deep linking.
Example: "Hey Google, set a smart alarm for 7 AM that only rings if it's sunny"

4. Smart Home/IoT Integration
Problem: Users want alarms to control their smart home environment.
Solution: Integration with popular smart home platforms.
Implementation: IoT platform APIs, device discovery, action scheduling.
Example: "30 min before alarm: adjust thermostat, 15 min: brighten lights, alarm time: start coffee"
