My Shared Alarms Contributions

What I Worked On
I focused on fixing and improving the shared alarms system that was initially implemented by my mentor. My contributions were primarily in the Android native layer, backend integration, and resolving critical bugs.

My Specific Contributions

1. Android Native Integration (GetLatestAlarm.kt)
I completely rewrote the alarm scheduling logic in GetLatestAlarm.kt to properly handle shared alarms:
- Added logic to differentiate between local and shared alarms
- Implemented proper alarm scheduling for shared alarms with offset handling
- Fixed issues with shared alarms not being scheduled correctly
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging shared alarm scheduling

2. Backend Services Integration
I updated multiple Android services to support shared alarms:
- AlarmReceiver.kt: Added shared alarm handling in alarm triggers
- AlarmUtils.kt: Extended alarm utilities for shared alarm operations
- BootReceiver.kt: Ensured shared alarms restart properly after device reboot
- ScreenMonitorService.kt: Added separate activity tracking for shared vs local alarms

3. Firebase Messaging Integration
I enhanced FirebaseMessagingService.kt to properly handle shared alarm notifications:
- Improved push notification processing for shared alarms
- Added proper deep linking for shared alarm invitations
- Fixed notification payload handling for different shared alarm actions

4. Data Persistence Improvements
I worked on improving how shared alarms are stored and retrieved:
- Enhanced Firestore provider integration for shared alarms
- Improved local SQLite caching for offline shared alarm functionality
- Fixed synchronization issues between cloud and local storage

5. UI Component Fixes
I fixed several UI components related to shared alarms:
- alarm_offset_tile.dart: Fixed user offset management interface
- shared_users_tile.dart: Improved shared users display and management
- share_alarm_tile.dart: Enhanced alarm sharing interface
- Fixed overflow issues in share dialog

6. Controller Integration
I improved controller logic for shared alarms:
- home_controller.dart: Fixed shared alarm streaming and display
- alarm_ring_controller.dart: Added proper shared alarm ring handling
- add_or_update_alarm_controller.dart: Enhanced shared alarm state management

7. Critical Bug Fixes
My main contributions were solving critical issues:
- Fixed shared alarms not being scheduled on Android
- Resolved conflicts between shared and local alarm scheduling
- Fixed activity monitoring for shared alarms (separate tracking)
- Resolved synchronization issues between multiple users
- Fixed notification handling for shared alarm invitations

Key Challenges I Solved

1. Alarm Scheduling Conflicts
The biggest challenge was ensuring shared alarms didn't interfere with local alarms. I implemented separate scheduling logic and request codes for each alarm type.

2. Activity Monitoring Separation
I had to separate screen activity tracking between shared and local alarms by adding the shared parameter to updateScreenStatus() and using different SharedPreferences keys.

3. Native Android Integration
Integrating shared alarm functionality with Android's native alarm system required careful handling of alarm intents, scheduling, and notification processing.

4. Data Consistency
Ensuring shared alarms stayed synchronized between local SQLite and Firestore while handling offline scenarios.

Technical Implementation Details

My work focused on the native Android layer where shared alarms needed to integrate with the system:

Android Native Layer:
- GetLatestAlarm.kt: Complete rewrite of alarm scheduling logic
- AlarmReceiver.kt: Added shared alarm triggering logic
- Services: Enhanced all background services for shared alarm support

Backend Integration:
- Fixed Firestore synchronization issues
- Improved offline handling for shared alarms
- Enhanced push notification processing

Bug Resolution:
- Resolved scheduling conflicts
- Fixed activity monitoring separation
- Improved notification handling

Real-World Impact

My contributions solved critical functionality issues:
- Shared alarms now schedule properly on Android devices
- Users can reliably receive and participate in shared alarms
- The system properly handles both shared and local alarms simultaneously
- Activity monitoring works correctly for both alarm types


My contributions were essential for making the shared alarms feature actually functional on Android devices, transforming it from a concept into a working system.
