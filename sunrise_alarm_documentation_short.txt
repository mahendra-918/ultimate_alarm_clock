Sunrise Alarm Feature

What I Built
I implemented a sunrise alarm that gradually brightens the screen before the alarm rings, simulating natural sunrise to help users wake up more gently.

Why It Matters
Traditional alarms can be jarring. A sunrise alarm gradually prepares your body for waking up by mimicking natural light patterns, creating a more pleasant wake-up experience.

How It Works
Users can enable sunrise mode in alarm settings with:
- Duration: 5-60 minutes before alarm
- Intensity: 10-100% brightness
- Color Schemes: Natural (orange to white), Warm (red to gold), Cool (blue to white)
- Preview mode to test settings

The effect starts with a dark screen and gradually increases brightness with smooth color transitions, actually controlling the device's screen brightness.

Technical Implementation
Built using Flutter's animation system with:
- Brightness controller for screen brightness
- Color controller for smooth color transitions
- Three color schemes with natural gradient progressions
- Integration with device brightness settings

Key files created:
- sunrise_alarm_tile.dart: Settings UI component
- sunrise_effect_widget.dart: Core animation widget
- Enhanced alarm_model.dart: Added sunrise data fields

Challenges Solved
- Screen brightness integration across different Android versions
- Smooth color animations that look natural
- Seamless integration with existing alarm features (snooze, shared alarms)
- Proper animation lifecycle management

Results
Users can now enjoy gentler wake-ups with customizable sunrise effects. The feature integrates seamlessly with existing alarm functionality without breaking any current features.
