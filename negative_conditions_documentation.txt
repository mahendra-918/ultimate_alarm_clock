Negative Conditions for Smart Controls

What I Built
I implemented negative conditions that allow users to set alarms with inverted logic - instead of just "wake me when X happens," users can now set "don't wake me when X happens" or "wake me when X doesn't happen."

Why This Feature Matters
Traditional smart alarms only work in one direction. For example, location alarms could only say "wake me when I'm far from work." But users have different needs:
- "Don't wake me if I'm already at work" 
- "Wake me only when it's NOT raining"
- "Don't wake me if my phone is active (I'm already awake)"

Negative conditions give users complete control over when alarms should and shouldn't ring.

How It Works
The system extends the existing smart control types (Location, Weather, Activity) with negative variants:

Location Conditions:
- Ring When At - wake up when you arrive at a location
- Cancel When At - don't wake up if you're already at the location
- Ring When Away - wake up when you're away from a location  
- Cancel When Away - don't wake up if you're away from the location

Weather Conditions:
- Ring When Match - wake up when weather matches your selection
- Cancel When Match - don't wake up when weather matches
- Ring When Different - wake up when weather is different from selection
- Cancel When Different - don't wake up when weather is different

Activity Conditions:
- Ring When Active - wake up when phone is being used
- Cancel When Active - don't wake up if phone is active (you're already awake)
- Ring When Inactive - wake up when phone hasn't been used
- Cancel When Inactive - don't wake up if phone is inactive

Technical Implementation
The core implementation uses boolean inversion. Each condition type gets stored as an integer (0-4), and the backend logic applies the appropriate boolean operation:

For Location:
- Type 1: shouldRing = isNearLocation (normal)
- Type 2: shouldRing = !isNearLocation (negative)
- Type 3: shouldRing = !isNearLocation (negative, different meaning)
- Type 4: shouldRing = isNearLocation (negative, double inversion)

The key insight is that the same boolean logic can have different semantic meanings based on the condition type.

Code Architecture
I modified several core components:

1. Data Model: Added condition type fields to AlarmModel
2. UI Components: Extended tiles to show negative condition options
3. Backend Services: Updated LocationFetcherService.kt and WeatherFetcherService.kt with when() statements for each condition type
4. Enum Definitions: Added comprehensive condition type enums in constants.dart

Key Files Modified:
- constants.dart: Added condition type enums
- LocationFetcherService.kt: Implemented location condition logic
- WeatherFetcherService.kt: Implemented weather condition logic  
- location_activity_tile.dart: Added UI for negative location conditions
- weather_tile.dart: Added UI for negative weather conditions
- screen_activity_tile.dart: Added UI for negative activity conditions

Challenges I Solved
The main challenge was making the same boolean logic work for different semantic meanings. For example, both "Ring When Away" and "Cancel When At" use the same logic (!isNearLocation) but represent different user intentions.

I also had to ensure backward compatibility - existing alarms continue to work while new negative conditions provide additional flexibility.

Another challenge was UI design - clearly explaining to users what each negative condition means without making the interface confusing.

Real-World Examples
1. Work Alarm: "Cancel When At" - Don't wake me up if I'm already at the office
2. Rain Alarm: "Cancel When Match" - Don't wake me up if it's raining (I'll work from home)  
3. Sleep Alarm: "Cancel When Active" - Don't wake me up if I'm already using my phone
4. Travel Alarm: "Ring When Away" - Wake me up only when I'm away from home

Results
Users now have complete control over their smart alarms with both positive and negative conditions. The feature maintains backward compatibility while significantly expanding the flexibility of alarm conditions.

The implementation demonstrates how boolean logic can be combined with clear UI design to create powerful user features without overwhelming complexity.
