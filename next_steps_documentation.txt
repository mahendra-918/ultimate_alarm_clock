Next Steps - Second Half of GSoC

Priority Features (Weeks 7-10)

1. Multiple Smart Controls for Single Alarm

Problem: Currently users can only set one smart control type per alarm (either location OR weather OR activity).

Solution: Allow combining multiple smart controls with logical operators:
- Weather condition AND location condition
- Activity condition OR weather condition  
- Complex logic: "Ring when (sunny OR cloudy) AND (at work OR away from home)"

Technical Implementation:
- Extend AlarmModel to support multiple condition arrays
- Create condition builder UI with logical operators (AND/OR)
- Update backend services to evaluate multiple conditions
- Implement condition priority and evaluation order

User Experience:
Example: "Wake me up when it's sunny AND I'm at the gym OR when it's raining AND I'm at home"

2. Timezone-Aware Alarms

Problem: Travelers and remote workers struggle with alarms when crossing time zones.

Solution: Smart timezone detection and automatic alarm adjustment:
- Automatic timezone detection using device location
- Manual timezone override for planned travel
- Alarm time conversion with user confirmation
- Multi-timezone display for international teams

Technical Implementation:
- Integrate timezone detection APIs
- Create timezone conversion utilities
- Update alarm scheduling logic for timezone changes
- Add timezone display in alarm interface
- Handle edge cases (DST changes, international date line)

User Experience:
"Alarm set for 7:00 AM local time"
"Detected timezone change: NYC â†’ London. Adjust alarm to 7:00 AM GMT?"

3. Google Assistant Integration

Problem: Users want voice control for alarm management and hands-free interaction.

Solution: Deep Google Assistant integration for voice commands:
- Voice alarm creation: "Hey Google, set an alarm for 7 AM with weather condition"
- Voice alarm modification: "Hey Google, change my work alarm to 8 AM"
- Voice alarm status: "Hey Google, what alarms do I have tomorrow?"
- Smart suggestions based on calendar and habits

Technical Implementation:
- Implement Google Assistant Actions SDK
- Create voice command parsing and natural language processing
- Build deep linking from Assistant to app features
- Add voice feedback and confirmation system
- Integrate with existing alarm logic and smart controls

User Experience:
User: "Hey Google, set a smart alarm for tomorrow"
Assistant: "Setting alarm for 7 AM. Should it check weather or location?"
User: "Weather - only ring if it's sunny"
Assistant: "Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow, will only ring if sunny"

4. Smart Home/IoT Integration

Problem: Users want their alarms to control their smart home environment for better wake-up experience.

Solution: Integration with popular smart home platforms:
- Philips Hue integration: Gradual light brightening with sunrise alarm
- Smart thermostat control: Adjust temperature before wake-up time
- Smart speaker integration: Multi-room alarm announcements
- Smart curtains/blinds: Automatic opening with sunrise effect
- Coffee maker integration: Start brewing when alarm triggers

Technical Implementation:
- Integrate with major IoT platforms (Google Home, Alexa, SmartThings)
- Create device discovery and pairing system
- Build action scheduling system tied to alarm events
- Implement device control APIs and protocols
- Add device status monitoring and error handling

User Experience:
"30 minutes before alarm: Smart thermostat adjusts temperature"
"15 minutes before: Philips Hue starts gradual brightening"  
"Alarm time: Coffee maker starts brewing, curtains open"
"Snooze: Lights dim slightly, coffee stays warm"
