# Shared Alarm Notification Fixes

## Overview
Fixed multiple issues preventing shared alarm notifications from working properly. The changes improve FCM token handling, notification permissions, retry mechanisms, and debugging capabilities.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. FCM Token Registration Issues
- **Problem**: FCM tokens weren't properly handled when users weren't logged in
- **Solution**: Added retry mechanism for token retrieval and local storage for pending tokens
- **Files**: `lib/app/data/providers/push_notifications.dart`

### 2. Notification Permission Handling  
- **Problem**: Insufficient permission checking and error handling
- **Solution**: Enhanced permission requests with proper status checking
- **Files**: `lib/app/data/providers/push_notifications.dart`

### 3. Cloud Function Improvements
- **Problem**: Limited error reporting and retry capabilities  
- **Solution**: Added detailed logging, better error handling, and comprehensive response data
- **Files**: `functions/sendNotification.js`

### 4. Android Notification Handling
- **Problem**: Poor notification channel management and data handling
- **Solution**: Created dedicated notification channels and improved message processing
- **Files**: `android/.../FirebaseMessagingService.kt`

### 5. Silent Notification Issues
- **Problem**: Silent notifications weren't properly filtered
- **Solution**: Added proper silent notification detection and handling
- **Files**: Multiple files

## New Features Added

### Enhanced Debugging
- Added `checkNotificationStatus()` function to diagnose notification issues
- Comprehensive logging throughout the notification pipeline
- Better error messages with actionable information

### Retry Mechanisms
- FCM token retrieval with exponential backoff
- Notification sending with multiple retry attempts
- Automatic token update retry on failure

### Improved Notification Channels
- Dedicated channels for different notification types
- Better notification appearance with big text style
- Proper intent handling when notifications are tapped

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Check Notification Status
```dart
// Add this to your app to debug notification issues
final status = await checkNotificationStatus();
print('Notification Status: $status');
```

### 2. Verify User Setup
Both users need to:
1. Be logged in with Google account
2. Have notification permissions enabled
3. Have a valid FCM token registered

### 3. Test Shared Alarm Flow
1. User A creates and enables shared alarm
2. User A shares alarm with User B
3. Check logs for notification sending process
4. User B should receive notification

### 4. Monitor Logs
- **Flutter logs**: Look for üîî, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå emoji markers
- **Firebase Console**: Check Cloud Function logs  
- **Android logs**: Filter for "FCM" tag

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No FCM token found"
**Solution**: 
- Check if user is logged in
- Verify notification permissions
- Call `updateStoredTokenIfNeeded()` after login

### Issue: "Cloud Function not working"
**Solution**:
- Check Firebase project setup
- Verify Cloud Functions deployment
- Check network connectivity

### Issue: "Notifications not showing on Android"
**Solution**:
- Check notification channel settings
- Verify app has notification permissions
- Check if battery optimization is disabled

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/app/data/providers/push_notifications.dart` - Major improvements to FCM handling
2. `functions/sendNotification.js` - Enhanced Cloud Function with better error handling  
3. `android/.../FirebaseMessagingService.kt` - Improved Android notification handling

### Key Improvements:
- 3x retry mechanism for failed notifications
- Comprehensive logging and debugging
- Better error handling throughout the pipeline
- Proper notification channel management
- Silent notification support

## Next Steps
1. Test the notification flow between two devices
2. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
3. Deploy Cloud Function updates if needed
4. Consider adding user-facing error messages for notification issues

## Debugging Commands
- Check notification status: `await checkNotificationStatus()`
- Force token update: `await updateStoredTokenIfNeeded()`  
- Test notification: Share an alarm and monitor logs

The fixes should resolve the notification delivery issues. Monitor the logs closely during testing to identify any remaining problems.
