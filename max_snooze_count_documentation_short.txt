Max Snooze Count Feature

What I Built
I implemented a max snooze count feature that prevents users from snoozing alarms indefinitely. Users can set a limit (1-10 times) on how many times they can snooze, ensuring they eventually wake up.

Why It Matters
The biggest problem with alarms is infinite snoozing - users hit snooze repeatedly and oversleep. This feature gives controlled flexibility while preventing chronic lateness.

How It Works
Users set a maximum snooze limit when creating alarms. The system tracks snooze attempts and prevents further snoozing once the limit is reached.

Features:
- Configurable limit: 1-10 snoozes (default: 3)
- Real-time counter: "Snooze X/Y" display
- Prevention message when limit reached
- Integration with existing snooze settings

Technical Implementation
Added maxSnoozeCount field to AlarmModel with database integration. Created UI components for configuration and enforcement logic in alarm controller.

Key Code Components:
- MaxSnoozeCountTile: NumberPicker UI for setting limits
- Enforcement logic: Checks current count vs max limit
- Real-time display: Shows progress during alarm
- State management: GetX observables for reactive updates

Enforcement Logic:
```dart
if (snoozeCount.value >= actualMaxSnoozeCount) {
    Get.snackbar("Max Snooze Limit", "You've reached the maximum snooze limit");
    return;
}
snoozeCount.value++;
```

Challenges Solved
- Data consistency between configuration and active alarm
- Real-time UI updates for snooze progress
- Database schema updates with backward compatibility
- User-friendly limit enforcement

Results
Users now have meaningful control over snoozing behavior. The feature prevents oversleeping while allowing some flexibility for difficult mornings.
