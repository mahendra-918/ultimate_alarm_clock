Debug Logs and Alarm History Feature

What I Built
I implemented a comprehensive debug logging system and alarm history feature that tracks every alarm operation, provides detailed troubleshooting information, and gives users visibility into their alarm behavior.

Why This Feature Matters
Alarm apps often fail silently - users don't know why alarms didn't ring or when they were modified. This creates frustration and reduces trust in the app. Debug logs solve this by:
- Providing complete transparency of alarm operations
- Enabling troubleshooting when alarms fail
- Tracking alarm history for user reference
- Helping developers debug complex alarm issues
- Building user confidence through visibility

How It Works
The system logs every alarm operation across both Flutter and Android layers, storing detailed information in a SQLite database with a user-friendly interface for viewing and filtering logs.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive alarm lifecycle tracking
- Real-time log viewing with auto-refresh
- Advanced filtering (status, date range, search)
- Developer mode for technical logs
- Color-coded status indicators
- Message parsing for structured display

User Experience:
1. Access "Alarm History" from app drawer
2. View chronological list of all alarm events
3. Filter logs by status (ERROR, WARNING, SUCCESS)
4. Search by alarm time, ID, or message content
5. Toggle developer mode for technical details
6. Clear logs when needed

Technical Implementation
Built dual-layer logging system with SQLite persistence and advanced UI.

Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE LOG (
    LogID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  
    LogTime DATETIME NOT NULL,            
    Status TEXT CHECK(Status IN ('ERROR', 'SUCCESS', 'WARNING')) NOT NULL,
    LogType TEXT CHECK(LogType IN ('DEV', 'NORMAL')) NOT NULL,
    Message TEXT NOT NULL,
    HasRung INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    AlarmID TEXT
)
```

Android Native Logging:
- LogDatabaseHelper.kt: SQLite database operations
- Integrated across all Android services (AlarmReceiver, LocationFetcherService, WeatherFetcherService)
- Real-time logging of alarm triggers, conditions, and system events

Flutter Layer Integration:
- Debug view with advanced filtering and search
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Message parsing for structured display
- Developer mode toggle for technical logs

UI Components:
- Expandable cards with status indicators
- Color-coded display (red=error, orange=warning, green=success)
- Search functionality across all log fields
- Date range filtering
- Status-based filtering
- Clear all logs with confirmation

Log Categories:
1. User-Facing Logs (NORMAL):
   - Alarm creation, updates, deletions
   - Alarm ring events with full context
   - Location and weather condition results
   - System boot alarm restoration

2. Developer Logs (DEV):
   - Technical debugging information
   - System state changes
   - Error diagnostics
   - Internal operation confirmations

Integration Points:
The logging system is integrated throughout the entire alarm lifecycle:
- Alarm CRUD operations
- System alarm scheduling
- Condition evaluations (weather/location)
- Alarm ring events
- Error handling and recovery

Challenges I Solved

1. Cross-Platform Logging
Ensuring consistent logging between Flutter and Android native code while maintaining proper data structure.

2. Performance Optimization
Implementing efficient database operations and UI updates without affecting alarm performance.

3. User Experience Design
Creating an interface that's useful for both regular users (alarm history) and developers (debugging).

4. Data Management
Handling large log volumes with proper filtering, search, and cleanup capabilities.

5. Message Structure
Parsing diverse log messages into structured, readable format for users.

Code Architecture
Multi-layer implementation with proper separation:

Database Layer:
- SQLite database for persistent log storage
- Structured schema with status and type categorization
- Efficient queries for filtering and search

Android Integration:
- LogDatabaseHelper: Database operations
- Comprehensive logging across all alarm services
- Real-time event tracking

Flutter UI Layer:
- Debug view with advanced filtering
- Real-time updates and auto-refresh
- Search and filter functionality
- Developer mode toggle

Message Processing:
- Intelligent parsing of log messages
- Structured display of alarm events
- Technical detail extraction

Results
Users now have complete visibility into their alarm behavior, and developers have comprehensive debugging capabilities. The system builds trust through transparency while providing powerful troubleshooting tools.

Real-World Impact:
- Users can see exactly when and why alarms ring or don't ring
- Support teams can quickly diagnose alarm issues
- Developers can trace complex alarm behaviors
- Increased user confidence through transparency
- Faster debugging and issue resolution

The feature demonstrates full-stack development skills, database design, and user experience thinking around transparency and debugging.
