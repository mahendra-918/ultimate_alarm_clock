## üêõ **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND**

### Bug 1: Empty Weather Array Parsing Error
- **Issue:** When no weather types are selected, the system passes an empty array `[]`
- **Error:** `For input string: ""` in weather type parsing
- **Impact:** Still works but generates error logs
- **Fix Needed:** Handle empty weather arrays gracefully

### Bug 2: CANCEL_WHEN_DIFFERENT (Index 4) Not Working
- **Issue:** Alarms with condition type 4 (CANCEL_WHEN_DIFFERENT) are not triggering WeatherFetcherService
- **Evidence:** No WeatherFetcherService logs for 22:20 and 22:21 alarms
- **Impact:** Condition type 4 completely non-functional
- **Fix Needed:** Check why WeatherFetcherService is not started for condition type 4
