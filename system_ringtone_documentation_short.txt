System Ringtone Feature

What I Built
I implemented system ringtone integration that allows users to select and use their device's built-in alarm sounds, notification tones, and ringtones through native Android integration.

Why It Matters
Users prefer familiar system sounds for alarms instead of custom files. System ringtones are optimized for alarm usage, require no storage space, and provide consistent audio experience.

How It Works
The feature bridges Flutter with Android's RingtoneManager to access system sounds. Users browse three categories (Alarm, Notification, Ringtone) with real-time preview functionality.

Technical Implementation
Built multi-layer architecture with native Android integration:

Android Native Layer:
- RingtoneManager integration in MainActivity.kt
- Audio focus and volume management
- MethodChannel communication with Flutter

Flutter Service Layer:
- SystemRingtoneService for platform communication
- Audio playback control and error handling
- Categorized ringtone fetching

UI Components:
- SystemRingtonePicker: Tabbed interface for browsing categories
- Real-time preview with play/stop controls
- Integration with existing ringtone selection system

Key Code Implementation:
```kotlin
private fun getSystemRingtones(category: String): List<Map<String, Any>> {
    val ringtoneType = when (category) {
        "alarm" -> RingtoneManager.TYPE_ALARM
        "notification" -> RingtoneManager.TYPE_NOTIFICATION
        "ringtone" -> RingtoneManager.TYPE_RINGTONE
    }
    // Query system ringtones using RingtoneManager
}
```

Data Models:
- SystemRingtoneModel: Simple model for system ringtone data
- Enhanced RingtoneModel: Added isSystemRingtone, ringtoneUri, category fields

Challenges Solved
- Native platform integration with RingtoneManager API
- Audio management with proper focus and volume handling
- UI design for organizing hundreds of system sounds
- Performance optimization for loading system ringtones

Results
Users now have access to high-quality device ringtones alongside custom sounds, providing familiar audio experience with professional alarm behavior.
