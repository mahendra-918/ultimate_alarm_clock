Debug Logs and Alarm History Feature

What I Built
I implemented a comprehensive debug logging system that tracks every alarm operation and provides users with complete alarm history and troubleshooting information.

Why It Matters
Alarm apps often fail silently - users don't know why alarms didn't ring. This feature provides complete transparency and enables troubleshooting through detailed logging.

How It Works
The system logs every alarm operation across Flutter and Android layers, storing information in SQLite database with a user-friendly interface for viewing and filtering.

Features:
- Complete alarm lifecycle tracking
- Advanced filtering (status, date range, search)
- Developer mode for technical logs
- Color-coded status indicators (ERROR, WARNING, SUCCESS)
- Real-time updates with auto-refresh

Technical Implementation
Built dual-layer logging system with SQLite persistence:

Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE LOG (
    LogID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  
    LogTime DATETIME NOT NULL,            
    Status TEXT CHECK(Status IN ('ERROR', 'SUCCESS', 'WARNING')) NOT NULL,
    LogType TEXT CHECK(LogType IN ('DEV', 'NORMAL')) NOT NULL,
    Message TEXT NOT NULL,
    HasRung INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    AlarmID TEXT
)
```

Key Components:
- LogDatabaseHelper.kt: Android SQLite operations
- debug_view.dart: Flutter UI with filtering and search
- Integration across all alarm services
- Real-time logging of triggers, conditions, and events

Log Categories:
1. User Logs (NORMAL): Alarm events, ring history, condition results
2. Developer Logs (DEV): Technical debugging, system state changes

UI Features:
- Expandable cards with status indicators
- Search across all log fields
- Date range and status filtering
- Developer mode toggle
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

Challenges Solved
- Cross-platform logging consistency
- Performance optimization for large log volumes
- User-friendly interface for technical information
- Efficient database operations and filtering

Results
Users have complete visibility into alarm behavior, and developers have comprehensive debugging capabilities. Builds trust through transparency while providing powerful troubleshooting tools.
