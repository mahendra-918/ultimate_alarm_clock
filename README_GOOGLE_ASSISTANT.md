# Google Assistant Integration for Ultimate Alarm Clock

This feature enables users to control the Ultimate Alarm Clock app using voice commands through Google Assistant. Users can set, modify, and manage alarms using natural language, making the app more accessible and convenient for everyday use.

## Features

- **Create alarms** using voice commands
- **Cancel existing alarms** by referencing their label
- **Enable/disable alarms** by referencing their label
- Natural language processing for intuitive interaction

## Voice Command Examples

Here are some examples of voice commands that users can use with Google Assistant:

- "Hey Google, set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow in Ultimate Alarm Clock"
- "Hey Google, set a daily alarm for 6:00 AM labeled 'Work' in Ultimate Alarm Clock"
- "Hey Google, cancel my 'Work' alarm in Ultimate Alarm Clock"
- "Hey Google, disable my 'Weekend' alarm in Ultimate Alarm Clock"
- "Hey Google, enable my 'Gym' alarm in Ultimate Alarm Clock"

## Technical Implementation

The integration is implemented using App Actions, which allows Google Assistant to interact with the app through predefined intents. The implementation consists of:

1. **Actions.xml**: Defines the supported actions and parameters
2. **Intent Filters**: Added to the Android Manifest to handle deep links
3. **GoogleAssistantHandler.kt**: Kotlin class to process intents from Google Assistant
4. **GoogleAssistantService.dart**: Flutter service to handle commands from the native platform

## Setup for Development

To test the Google Assistant integration during development:

1. Build and install the app on an Android device
2. Use the App Actions Test Tool in Android Studio:
   - Go to Tools > App Actions > App Actions Test Tool
   - Select the app and test the defined actions

## Publishing Requirements

To make the Google Assistant integration available to users:

1. Ensure the app is published on Google Play Store
2. Submit the App Actions for review through the Google Play Console
3. Once approved, users can use voice commands with Google Assistant to interact with the app

## Limitations

- The integration is currently only available for Android devices
- Some complex alarm configurations may require using the app directly
- Voice commands must follow specific patterns to be recognized correctly

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex alarm configurations via voice
- Integration with Google Assistant Routines
- Support for more languages and regional variations in commands
